# Exposure

* Aperture

  * small number wider aperture: Ex f1.8 (brighter) will allow more light than f4.5 (darker)

* Shutter

  * smaller number means slow shutter speed - more light but can cause motion blurness

* ISO

  * smaller number means less light but less noise, use this only when Aperture and Shutter cant help to increase/decrease ligh
